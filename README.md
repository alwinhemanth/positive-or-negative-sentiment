# Sentiment Analysis: Positive or Negative

This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning to classify text data into **positive** or **negative** sentiment categories. It demonstrates data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and performance comparison.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `sentiment.ipynb` – Main Jupyter notebook containing the full analysis.
- `README.md` – Project overview and instructions.

## 🧠 Models Used

The following models are implemented and compared:

- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes
- Decision Tree

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

The models are evaluated using:

- **Accuracy**
- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **F1 Score**

## 📌 Key Features

- Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, etc.)
- TF-IDF vectorization
- Training multiple classifiers
- Model performance comparison
- F1 score analysis for each sentiment class
